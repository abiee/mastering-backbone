Model bindings
===================
The chapter teaches you can use the Backbone.Models effectively, and how you can combine them with Backbone.Views. You will see strategies to render complex objects, and how to run validations.

Setup and run
---
Remember that you will need to have a node version 5.2 or superior. Install the project dependencies.

    $ npm install

To run the project is as easy as call the `start` script.

    $ npm start

The project includes a linter ([eslint](http://eslint.org/)) to statically check the source code. You can run the linter with the `lint` script.

    $ npm run lint
